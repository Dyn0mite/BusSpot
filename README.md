BusSpot
=======

Start of bus stop est time of arrival app For the basis of this app I want to take the DCC bus timetable and create a program that checks system time of users device and reports back how far away in minutes the bus is from bus stop. This is intended to be used for the bus system in Dunedin Otago. Most if not all bus stops in Dunedin have a timetable printed out somewhere near the bus stop. Printed on the timetable are a bus stop number and the different times the bus is scheduled to pass the stop, these are often confusing and formatted terribly. BusSpot will allow users to enter the bus stop number and then return how far away the next bus is in minutes. The aim will be to build upon this to allow users to check in to bus to allow other users to know if bus is running early/late. This will be incetivised by rewarding users for checking in when this data is used to return real time information to other users who request bus time info.
